        "Bacterial blight causes leaf spots, blights, and eventual defoliation.\n"
        "- Remove and burn infected leaves to stop further spread.\n"
        "- Spray bactericides like streptomycin or copper oxychloride weekly.\n"

        "Dry leaf symptoms may indicate dehydration or salt buildup.\n"
        "- Water deeply and regularly, especially during dry spells.\n"

        "- Continue regular monitoring for pests or changes in leaf color.\n"

    'Sooty_Mould': (
        "Sooty mold is a black fungus that grows on honeydew excreted by insects.\n"
        "- First, control sap-sucking insects like aphids, mealybugs, or whiteflies.\n"
        "- Use neem oil or insecticidal soap sprays to eliminate insect sources.\n"
        "- Gently wash the leaves with warm water and mild soap to remove mold.\n"
        "- Encourage natural predators like ladybugs in your garden."
    ),
    'Spider_Mites': (
        "Spider mites cause yellow speckling and webbing on leaves.\n"
        "- Increase humidity around plants, as mites thrive in dry conditions.\n"
        "- Spray plants with a strong stream of water to knock mites off.\n"
        "- Use miticides or horticultural oils (e.g., neem, canola oil).\n"
        "- Introduce beneficial mites or insects (like lacewings) for biological control."
